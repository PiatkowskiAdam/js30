# My attempts on JS 30

I took a slightly different approach than the author intended, namely I decided to build every single app from scratch, rather than using the "Start" files provided.

I simply looked up at the beginning what the final product was, I played with it for a minute or two and then I tried to build my own app having the same/similar functionality, without peeking at the original code. When stuck, I tried searching other sources first (stack overflow, youtube etc.). I did analyse Wes'es solutions a few times over the course of all 30 lessons, but only when really, really stuck (or when not really understanding what the actual goal is).

The final product hadn't always been as good as the author's, but because I created everything from scratch, I think I learnt much more in the process, and that was my goal in taking this course. Learning new skills and practicising the ones I already had was my sole purpose for this project.

As a final note, I enjoyed the course immensely! Some lessons were incredibly cool, some were merely ok, but overall it was a great experience. I'm really happy that I stumbled across JS30 and I recommend it to any beginner who wants to up their JS game.
